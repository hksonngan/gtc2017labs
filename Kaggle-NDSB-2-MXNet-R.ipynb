The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/data) consists of hundreds of cardiac MRI images in [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) format.

    "[MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility by DMLC group. MXNet will fully utilize all the resources to solve the problem under limited resource constraint, with a flexible programming interface. You can use it for all purposes of data science and deep learning tasks with R, Julia, Python and more. To run on multiple GPU with huge network, or questions about saving network parameters etc, please refer [MXNet docs](https://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Overview of Model\n",
    "### Input Data\n",
    "The dataset itself contains 500 training studies with on average 10 unique SAX observation at various points along the the PLAX of the left ventricle.  That’s roughly 5000 observations in total.  Each of these SAX observation usually contain 30 DICOM images (“frames”) in a time sequence which captures an entire heartbeat (expansion and contraction).   The idea here is to pack each of the 30 image frames of an observation into a 64x64x30 tensor.  While this might sound complicated, just think of stacking playing cards to form a deck.  Each card has the same rectangular dimensions (say, 120x90) and then cards are stacked one on top of the other to form a deck.  It’s the same thing here.  We’re going to take each of the 30 square image frames of 64x64 pixels and stack them one-by-one to form an input “deck” to the deep neural network.  The only difference with the card deck analogy is that the image frames are organized in time so that the video clip of the heartbeat is not all garbled.  This tutorial is based on this simple idea: we first accumulate all suitable observations having 30 frames, then feed to the deep neural network to learn the target directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The label data set contains only 500 labels. That is, each of the roughly 10 SAX observation for a particular study get the same diastole and systole volume.  Again, each SAX observation of a study is just a different view of the same heart (i.e. a single heartbeat as measured from different cross sections perpendicular to the long axis of the heart).  Therefore, in the data preprocessing step, each label must be duplicated for each unique observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the same 64x64x30 deck of images is used to predict both systole and diastole volumes.  Therefore, we’re going to build a network that ingests each observation tensor to predict systole volume.  Then a separate network that ingests that same image deck to predict diastole volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea used in this tutorial is taking a frame-by-frame difference to measure change per frame (in time).  By using MXNet symbolic interface, we can dynamically difference the input inside of the network. It helps a little in the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Objective\n",
    "For the network, we use the well documented LeNet style convolution network with batch normalization and dropout. This is a basic network with a generic configuration.  In this challenge, we are asked to predict a CDF value of 600 data-point. Therefore the problem is formulated as a regression problem. We ask the neural-net that given a stack of images 64x64x30 to output 600x1 vector - one predicted value for each of the 600 points in the CDF.  Note here that the label is just a single floating point value like 83.3 (mL).  This label is transformed into a step function having 600 discrete values where all the y-values of the CDF with x less than 83 are 0 and all y-values with x greater than 83 are 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "We first run a preprocessing step, to pack the data into a csv file (```train-64x64-data.csv```).  Each line of this csv file corresponds to a 64 x 64 x 30 tensor, which gives 30 frames of images. We can also use other inputs besides csv. The CSV is used here since this format is common for all languages and is easy to parse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input dataset is quite big (5293 observations of size 64x64x30). While this data set can likely fit into memory of a big machine, we want to be safe, so we will use the ```CSVIter``` from ```mxnet``` to load data from disk on-the-fly during training, without loading all the data into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels for the training data are stored in ```train-systole.csv``` and ```train-diastole.csv``` where each line is a step function of 0s and 1s as described above. Line ```i``` in the training CSV data file is label by the associated line ```i``` in the label CSV files.  Again, when training the systole network we will use labels from ```train-systole.csv``` and likewise when training the diastole network we will use labels from ```train-diastole.csv```.\n",

    "Next we define a function that will architect (not trained yet) neural networks.  This network is a classic network that has it's origins from Yann LeCun's paper many years ago and hence has the nastalgic name \"LeNet\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice here that we create a variable using ```mx.symbol.Variable``` which *represents* the input data.  Just like regular variables we can manipulate the ```source``` variable.  For example, the first thing we do to the image data input is to normalize the pixel values. Next we utilize ```mx.symbol.SliceChannel``` so that we can actually access each individual frame of the input.  Recall that the input is 64x64x30 so that each indexed frame is of size 64x64. The purpose of using the frames is so that differences between successive frames can be calculated. That is, instead of training the network parameters using the images directly, the network is trained on the differences between each successive frame.  This is pretty cool since we can actually manipulate the data within the network definition rather than having to preprocess the whole dataset when we want to experiment with a new idea.  Once each frame delta has been computed the individual frames are put back into a 64x64x29 tensor input using ```mxnet:::mx.varg.symbol.Concat```.  Since we've taken successive deltas we actually only have 29 total deltas now!  \n",
    "\n",
    "From here we just chain various layers together, such as ```mx.symbol.Convolution```, to form the network described in LeCun's paper.  There is no magic here.  Feel free to add layers in between or remove layers etc.  That's part of the fun of working with DL; various recipies have been described in papers over the years but you're free to construct anything you'd like.  Play with the network structure to get a feel for how training performance changes. \n",

The CRPS scores for the leaderboard top ten ranged from 0.009485 in first place to 0.012611 in tenth place.  To get a better feel for how your results stackup against the competion, we can create an empirical CDF from the leaderboard CRPS scores\n",

    "Analysis of the competion results seem more favorable than this graphic might imply and noted that top performer models agreed well with previous studies of human performance.  For a medical perspective on the competion results check out this [kaggle blog](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/forums/t/19839/a-medical-perspective-on-the-quality-of-the-left-ventricular-volume-and) by Dr. Andrew Arai of the NIH.  Additional analysis of the clinical applicability provided by Jonathan Mulholland of Booze Allen Hamilton [here](http://www.datasciencebowl.com/leading-and-winning-team-submissions-analysis/). These analysis conclude, based on the top four models submitted to the competion, that \"*The models keep the diagnosis categories pretty tightly grouped together. While the models are not right 100% the time, there is a very low probability of a severely abnormal EF being incorrectly categorized in the mild to hyperdynamic range. The normal to mild diagnoses are very likely to stay within their domain ... This is a pretty good sign pointing towards suitability for clinical applications*\"."
