Another more advanced way to represent input data would be to construct an [Inputs And Readers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/io_ops#inputs_and_readers) that represents a file or other data source, and iterates through the file as TensorFlow runs the graph. Each continuous column in the train or test dataframe will be converted into a *Tensor,* which in general is a good format to represent dense data. For categorical data, we must represent the data as a *SparseTensor.* This data format is good for representing sparse data."

    "### Adding Regularization to Prevent Overfitting\n",
    "---\n",
    "Regularization is a technique used to avoid **overfitting.** Overfitting happens when your model does well on the data it is trained on, but worse on test data that the model has not seen before, such as live traffic. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observed training data. Regularization allows for you to control your model's complexity and makes the model more generalizable to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3 - Experiment with hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Linear Model library, you can add L1 and L2 regularizations to the model. One important difference between L1 and L2 regularization is that L1 regularization tends to make model weights stay at zero, creating sparser models, whereas L2 regularization also tries to make the model weights closer to zero but not necessarily zero. Therefore, if you increase the strength of L1 regularization, you will have a smaller model size because many of the model weights will be zero. This is often desirable when the feature space is very large but sparse, and when there are resource constraints that prevent you from serving a model that is too large.\n",

You can check out TensorFlow's [Wide & Deep Learning Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep) where they'll show you how to combine the strengths of linear models and deep neural networks by jointly training them. You can add code blocks to this notebook using the '+' under 'File' to work through that tutorial.\n",

There's another dataset loaded to this instance (from [Kaggle.com](kaggle.com/datasets)) which contains metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings (2012-2016) for the S&P 500. Pick a target column to predict and create a linear model using the workflow we just learned. Start with<code> df_train2 = pd.read_csv('fundamentals.csv', skipinitialspace=True)</code> to read the dataset to a Pandas dataframe.\n",
